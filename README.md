### bts
for our group project, we decided on making a card-based game, similar to "Slay the Spire". We planned out the story, characters, art and how the game would play. as this was only a prototype, we were only required to complete a single level for the assignment. unfortunately, we had issues with one of our members (the programmer), so I had to fill in for him and code the game to a playable state with the time we had left. i was allowed to use Unity (C#) to create our game, something I was thankfully already familiar with. we called our game "Toxis".
